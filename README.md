# Git for Courses

Documents in this repository describe how different Illinois courses have used
git for student assignment distribution, collection, grading, regrades, etc.

For feedback, contact Dave Mussulman (<mussulma@illinois.edu>). Issues and PR's welcomed.

## Services

Git is a version control systems for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on these files among multiple people. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

Git is often paired with a server component that gives a web front-end to the data, handles collaboration and discovery across projects, and adds more collaborative features like issues, wikis, web-hosting, etc.

Some of these used at Illinois:

### GitHub.com

The venerable cloud-based git service, [github.com](github.com), has a [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) program which supplies free hosting for students and courses. The GitHub username is independent from your Illinois netid or password.

It's not entirely clear the FERPA risks of using GitHub's cloud service for student sensitive data.

## GitLab

Engineering IT hosts a GitLab Community Edition service at https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu Login uses the Illinois NetID and password.

Because the service is running on-premise by Illinois staff, there are no third-party FERPA risks for using gitlab.engr with courses.

## GitHub Enterprise

Computer Science has been piloting courses using an on-campus GitHub Enterprise service at https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu. Login uses the Illinois NetID and password. This service can leverage Active Directory groups for permissions, such as roster groups or course staff groups (managed at https://my.engr.illinois.edu/classtools).

Because the service is running on-premise by Illinois staff, there are no third-party FERPA risks for using github-dev.cs with courses.
